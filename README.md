The main stadium of an Olympics is the most integral location as it hosts the opening and closing ceremonies, the lighting of the touch and the most popular events [19]. The architecture and design choices of these stadiums ensure athletes can compete in optimal circumstances and thousands of spectators can experience these feats [18]. This project will highlight the ingenuity of these stadiums by offering the opportunity to view its design in detail as a competitor on its athletic track. The end goal is to have a model of an athlete posed as running able to move along an athletic track surrounded by stadium seating and accompanied by props.

In addition to the report a presentation was given providing an overview.
